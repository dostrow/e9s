# e9s - ElasticMS The Elastic Management System

An interactive terminal UI for managing AWS infrastructure from a single tool. Browse and operate on ECS, EC2, ECR, CloudWatch Logs, CloudWatch Alarms, SSM Parameter Store, Secrets Manager, S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, SQS, CodeBuild, Route53, and OpenTofu/Terraform workspaces.

Inspired by [k9s](https://k9scli.io/) for Kubernetes. Built in Go with [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) and [lipgloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss). Colors adapt to your terminal's color scheme via ANSI color indices.

## Features

- **Full-screen framed UI** with bordered layout, scrollbar, info bar, and mode label
- **Mode switcher** — press `` ` `` to pick a module, or `ctrl+p` to reopen the current mode's entry picker
- **Context-sensitive help** — press `?` for a full keybinding overlay
- **Region switching** — `ctrl+r` to change AWS region on the fly
- **Config hot-reload** — edit `~/.config/e9s/config.yaml` (or `ctrl+e` to open in `$EDITOR`) and changes apply automatically
- **Saved bookmarks** — save frequently used paths, filters, queries, and multi-group selections with `W`
- **Terminal-adaptive colors** — uses ANSI indices 0–15 so colors match your terminal theme

## Modules

e9s is organized into modules accessible via the mode switcher (`` ` ``). Modules can be individually enabled or disabled in the config file.

### ECS

Navigate clusters → services → tasks → containers. Force new deployments, scale services, stop tasks, view deployment rollout progress, inspect service events, and monitor CPU/memory metrics with CloudWatch alarm status.

- **ECS Exec** — shell into running containers via Session Manager Plugin
- **Environment Variables** — view resolved env vars including SSM/Secrets Manager references with source labels and ARN toggle
- **Task Definition Diff** — compare task definitions between deployments
- **Standalone Tasks** — browse non-service tasks (Lambda-launched workers, one-off jobs)
- **Log Streaming** — tail CloudWatch logs per task, container, or entire service

### EC2 (EC2i)

Browse EC2 instances with name, state (color-coded), type, availability zone, private IP, and age. Filter by name, instance ID, IP, type, or state. Running instances sort first.

- **Instance Detail** — full metadata, networking (private/public IP, VPC, subnet), IAM role, AMI, key name, architecture
- **Security Groups** — inbound and outbound rules table with protocol, ports, and source/destination
- **EBS Volumes** — attached volumes with size, type, and state
- **Tags** — all instance tags
- **SSM Session** — shell into a running instance via Session Manager Plugin (`e`)
- **Console Output** — view the instance's serial console log for debugging boot issues (`c`)
- **State Management** — start (`S`), stop (`X`), reboot (`r`), and terminate (`T`) with confirmation

### CloudWatch Logs (CWL)

Browse log groups (by prefix or substring search), drill into log streams, and interact with logs.

- **Live Tail** — stream logs at the group or stream level with follow mode, search highlighting, and `n`/`N` match navigation
- **Log Search** — search across a time range (relative presets or custom UTC timestamps) using CloudWatch filter syntax; plain text is auto-quoted for literal matching
- **Multi-Group Search** — select multiple log groups with `space`, search across all of them, and save the selection for future use
- **Backward/Forward Fetch** — press `[`/`]` to load older or newer log chunks
- **Timestamp Modes** — cycle through relative, local, and UTC timestamps with `t`
- **Copy/Edit** — copy log buffer to clipboard (`y`) or open in `$EDITOR` (`o`)
- **Save to File** — export the current log buffer with `w`
- **Save/Delete Log Paths** — bookmark frequently used log groups, streams, and multi-group selections

### CloudWatch Alarms (CWA)

Browse all CloudWatch metric alarms with color-coded state (OK, ALARM, INSUFFICIENT_DATA). Filter by state on entry, filter by name/metric/namespace in the list.

- **Alarm Detail** — view configuration, dimensions, actions, and recent history
- **Toggle Actions** — enable or disable alarm actions with `a`
- **Set State** — manually set alarm state for testing with `S`
- **Timestamps** — toggle between local and UTC with `t`

### SSM Parameter Store

Browse SSM parameters by path prefix. View values (with decryption for SecureString), edit parameters with confirmation, and save prefixes for quick access.

### Secrets Manager

Browse secrets by name filter (true substring matching). View secret values as pretty-printed JSON with syntax coloring, inspect tags, and edit values with confirmation. Save filters for quick access.

### S3

Browse S3 buckets (search by name), navigate object keys as a file browser with folder-level navigation. View object metadata and tags, download individual objects or recursively download entire prefixes. Configurable default save directory.

### Lambda

Browse Lambda functions with runtime, state, memory, and timeout info. View environment variables with SSM/Secrets Manager resolution (same as ECS), tail CloudWatch logs, and search logs with the full CW Logs search flow.

### DynamoDB

Browse DynamoDB tables, scan items with pagination (press `]` to load more), and drill into item details.

- **Filter Scan** — filter by attribute with operators (=, <>, contains, begins_with, etc.)
- **PartiQL** — run arbitrary PartiQL queries with saved query support
- **Edit Fields** — edit individual field values via `$EDITOR` with type inference
- **Clone Items** — clone and modify items via `$EDITOR` for creating new entries

### SQS

Browse SQS queues (substring search), view queue stats and configuration, poll for messages, and inspect message details.

- **Send Messages** — compose messages via `$EDITOR` with FIFO support (group ID, deduplication ID)
- **Clone & Send** — clone an existing message for re-sending
- **DLQ Navigation** — jump to the dead letter queue from a queue's detail view
- **Delete Messages** — delete individual messages with confirmation

### CodeBuild

Browse CodeBuild projects, view build history per project, and inspect build details.

- **Build Detail** — view phases with durations and error contexts, source info, environment variables, and log location
- **View Logs** — open the build's CloudWatch log stream in the log viewer (full history for completed builds, follow mode for in-progress)
- **Search Logs** — server-side search across the full build log with `s`
- **Start Build** — trigger a new build with `b` (with confirmation)
- **Stop Build** — stop an in-progress build with `x`

### ECR

Browse ECR repositories, view images with vulnerability scan summaries, and drill into scan findings.

- **Repository List** — name, scan-on-push status, tag mutability, encryption type. Filterable.
- **Image List** — tags, digest, push date, size, scan status, vulnerability summary (C:2 H:5 M:12 format, color-coded). Newest first.
- **Scan Findings** — severity (color-coded CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), CVE ID, package, version, description. Sorted by severity.
- **Start Scan** — trigger on-demand image scan with `s`
- **Copy URI** — copy full image URI to clipboard with `y`
- **Delete Image** — remove by digest with `x` (with confirmation)

### Route53

- **Hosted Zones** — zone name, public/private type, record count, comment. Filterable.
- **Record Sets** — name, type (color-coded), TTL, values (with alias target display), routing policy. Filterable.
- **Record Detail** — full values, alias info, routing policy details (weighted, latency, failover, geolocation), health check ID
- **Test DNS** — resolve a record via the Route53 `TestDNSAnswer` API with `t` — shows response code, nameserver, and resolved data
- **Create/Edit/Delete Records** — create (`n`) or edit (`e`) records via `$EDITOR` with JSON templates, delete (`x`) with confirmation

### OpenTofu / Terraform (TF)

Manage infrastructure-as-code workspaces directly from e9s. Point at any directory containing `.tf` files to browse state, run plans, and apply changes.

- **Path Completion** — interactive directory picker with tab-completion and fuzzy directory matching as you type
- **State Browser** — list all resources in state with type, name, and module path. Filterable. Drill in to view full `state show` output.
- **Plan Visualization** — runs `tofu plan -json` and parses the structured output into a clean, readable table:
  - Color-coded actions: `+ create` (green), `~ update` (yellow), `- delete` (red), `-/+ replace` (magenta)
  - Summary header with counts: `+3 ~1 -1`
  - Drill into individual changes to see before->after attribute diffs with add/change/remove color coding
  - Changes sorted: deletes first, then replaces, updates, creates
- **Apply** — runs `tofu apply` interactively (terminal handoff, same as ECS Exec)
- **Init** — runs `tofu init` with `i`
- **Save Workspaces** — bookmark directories for quick access with `W`
- Auto-detects `tofu` vs `terraform` in PATH

GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o e9s.exe .
```

## Dependencies

### Session Manager Plugin (for ECS Exec)

The `e` keybinding (shell into container) requires the AWS Session Manager Plugin binary in your `PATH`.

**Ubuntu/Debian:**

```bash
curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/session-manager-downloads/plugin/latest/ubuntu_64bit/session-manager-plugin.deb" -o session-manager-plugin.deb
sudo dpkg -i session-manager-plugin.deb
```

**macOS (Homebrew):**

```bash
brew install --cask session-manager-plugin
```

**Amazon Linux / RPM:**

```bash
curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/session-manager-downloads/plugin/latest/64bit/session-manager-plugin.rpm" -o session-manager-plugin.rpm
sudo yum install -y session-manager-plugin.rpm
```

**Windows:**

Download and run the installer from:

```
https://s3.amazonaws.com/session-manager-downloads/plugin/latest/windows/SessionManagerPluginSetup.exe
```

Verify: `session-manager-plugin --version`

> **Note:** ECS Exec also requires `enableExecuteCommand: true` on the ECS service and appropriate SSM permissions on the task IAM role. See the [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-exec.html) for setup details.
